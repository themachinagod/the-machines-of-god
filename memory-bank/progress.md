## Known Issues

1. Collision detection edge cases with fast-moving objects
2. Occasional frame rate drops with many entities
3. Enemy spawning needs better pacing and variety
4. UI elements need polish and consistency
5. Need improved visual feedback for player actions
6. Background is currently too static and simple

## Next Steps

1. **Short Term (1-2 weeks)**
   - Implement DartEnemy and ShieldBearer enemy types
   - Create basic formation system with static formations
   - Implement parallax scrolling background
   - Add simple asteroid obstacles
   - Improve missile tracking and collision behavior
   - Add visual feedback for player actions
   - Create PowerUp class and integrate with collectible system

2. **Medium Term (3-4 weeks)**
   - Complete remaining enemy types (at least 10 total)
   - Implement dynamic formation behaviors
   - Add environmental hazards (gravity wells, barriers)
   - Implement permanent upgrade system
   - Begin audio implementation
   - Add basic particle effects
   - Complete PowerUp system with multiple powerup types

3. **Long Term (1-2 months)**
   - Complete level structure
   - Implement boss enemies
   - Enhance environmental obstacles
   - Polish UI and visual effects
   - Conduct performance optimization

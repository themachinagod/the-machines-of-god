## Known Issues & Improvement Areas

- Enemy variety and behaviors are too simplistic and predictable
- Visuals lack impact with insufficient feedback for hits and explosions
- No sprite-based animation system, making characters look static
- Upgrade system lacks meaningful trade-offs and specialization paths
- Star collection system is monotonous without variety or combo mechanics
- No resource management systems for player (fuel, energy, etc.)
- Movement and control system lacks special maneuvers
- Sound and music system not implemented
- Visuals for enemies and player are placeholder quality
- Level design lacks variety and dynamic elements
- No narrative or story mode implemented
- Enemies don't form interesting patterns or coordinated groups
- No particle effects for explosions, thrusters, or weapons

## Recent Achievements

- Successfully implemented directional movement and firing system
- Added visually distinct player ship with clear directional indicators
- Implemented smooth auto-centering rotation with pause timer
- Fixed missile and projectile collision detection
- Added resume/new game functionality with proper save state management
- Refactored complex code sections to improve maintainability

# Machines of God - Progress

## Project Status: Initial Setup Phase

We are in the very early stages of project development. The memory bank and project structure have been established, and we are now ready to begin implementation of the core game systems.

## Completed Items

### Documentation
- [x] Project brief created
- [x] Product context defined
- [x] System patterns established
- [x] Technical context documented
- [x] Active context initialized
- [x] Project directory structure created

### Infrastructure
- [x] Set up package management with uv and pyproject.toml
- [x] Defined project dependencies
- [x] Configured Ruff linter for code quality
- [x] Configured mypy for static type checking
- [x] Created development guides for linting and typing

## In Progress

### Core Systems
- [ ] Basic game loop implementation
- [ ] State management framework
- [ ] Entity component system
- [ ] Resource management system

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Setting up development environment
- [ ] Setting up version control
- [ ] Setting up basic testing framework
- [ ] Linting existing code with Ruff
- [ ] Adding type annotations to existing code

## Upcoming Work

### Next Features
- [ ] Player spacecraft implementation
- [ ] Basic enemy types
- [ ] Projectile system
- [ ] Collision detection
- [ ] Basic scoring system

### Assets
- [ ] Placeholder player sprite
- [ ] Placeholder enemy sprites
- [ ] Placeholder projectile sprites
- [ ] Background assets
- [ ] Basic sound effects

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Create initial unit tests
- [ ] Implement pre-commit hooks for linting and type checking
- [ ] Set up CI/CD for automated testing, linting, and type checking
- [ ] Achieve baseline type coverage for core modules

## Current Blockers

- None currently identified

## Milestones

- [ ] Visual effects
- [ ] Comprehensive type annotations

### Milestone 4: Polishing (Target: [Date TBD])
- [ ] Menu system
- [ ] Save/load functionality
- [ ] Settings and configuration
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Final assets
- [ ] Full type coverage

## Known Issues

- No issues identified at this early stage

## Notes for Next Steps

- Need to establish coding standards and style guide
- Enforce coding standards with Ruff linter
- Define type annotation conventions and enforce with mypy
- Consider creating asset reference sheets for consistent visual style
- Begin prototyping core gameplay mechanics to validate feel

# Active Development Context

## Current Development Phase: Phase 2 - Enhanced Gameplay

Our project is now in Phase 2, focusing on enhanced gameplay features including enemy variety, angle-based shooting, and save/load functionality. We're building on the core game loop established in Phase 1 to create a more engaging and dynamic experience.

## Recent Developments

We've successfully implemented several key features:
- Angle-based shooting system that fires projectiles in the direction the player is facing
- Enhanced enemy variety with different movement patterns and behaviors
- Save/load game system with a "Resume Game" option in the main menu
- Basic progression system with score tracking
- Multiple projectile patterns (single, double, triple, quad)
- Basic collectible system for in-game upgrades

## Current Work Focus

Our active development priorities are:

1. **Enemy System Enhancement**
   - Implement additional enemy types:
     - DartEnemy: Fast, low health enemies that dash across screen
     - ShieldBearer: Directional shield requiring attacks from behind
     - TeleporterEnemy: Randomly teleports after taking damage
     - SplitterEnemy: Splits into two smaller enemies when destroyed
     - PulsarEnemy: Emits damaging energy waves periodically
     - OrbitalEnemy: Orbits around a point or another enemy
     - MineLayer: Drops stationary mines that explode on contact
     - PhaseEnemy: Alternates between solid/intangible states
     - RammerEnemy: Charges directly at player when in range
     - SwarmEnemy: Weak individually but appears in large groups
   - Implement formation system with behavior patterns:
     - V-shape, line, circle, square, diamond, X, wall, and arrow formations
     - Formation behaviors: static, rotating, wave, splitting, converging
   - Balance enemy health, movement speed, and point values
   - Add visual variety to clearly communicate enemy behaviors

2. **Environmental Enhancements**
   - Implement parallax scrolling background with multiple star layers
   - Add nebula cloud effects for visual variety
   - Implement obstacles and hazards:
     - Asteroid fields with destructible asteroids
     - Energy barriers that periodically activate/deactivate
     - Gravity wells affecting player and enemy movement
     - Wormholes for teleportation
     - Radiation zones that slowly damage entities within

3. **Weapons and Combat**
   - Fine-tune projectile and missile behavior
   - Implement additional projectile patterns
   - Add visual and audio feedback for combat
   - Improve missile tracking and collision detection

4. **Progression System**
   - Implement permanent upgrade system
   - Create meaningful progression between sessions
   - Design balanced upgrade costs and effects
   - Add visual indicators for equipped upgrades

5. **Polish and Feedback**
   - Add screen shake and particle effects
   - Improve collision detection and death animations
   - Add sound effects for various game events
   - Implement UI feedback for player actions

## Technical Architecture

The game is built with a state-based architecture using the following key components:

1. **Game State Management**
   - Main menu, playing state, shop, pause, and game over states
   - Smooth transitions between states
   - State-specific input handling and rendering

2. **Entity System**
   - Player with customizable weapons and attributes
   - Various enemy types with different behaviors
   - Projectiles, missiles, and collectibles
   - Health and damage system

3. **Collision System**
   - Group-based collision detection for efficiency
   - Custom handling for special collision cases
   - Health-based damage system

4. **Rendering System**
   - Layer-based rendering for depth control
   - Camera system for screen management
   - UI overlay for game information
   - Parallax background system for visual depth

5. **Input System**
   - Keyboard controls with configurable keys
   - Event-based and polling-based hybrid approach
   - Context-sensitive controls based on game state

6. **Save/Load System**
   - JSON-based save file format
   - Game state persistence between sessions
   - Error handling for data corruption

## Current Implementation Challenges

We're actively working to address these technical challenges:

1. **Enemy Formation System**
   - Need to implement a flexible formation manager
   - Coordinate movement of multiple enemies
   - Balance difficulty of formation-based attacks
   - Synchronize behavior among formation members

2. **Advanced Physics**
   - Implement more complex movement patterns
   - Improve collision response
   - Add environmental effects (gravity wells, etc.)
   - Handle interactions between different force fields

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Maintain 60 FPS target with many entities
   - Implement object pooling for projectiles and particles
   - Optimize collision detection for large numbers of entities
   - Manage memory for dynamic environment elements

4. **UI Polish**
   - Create more responsive menu interactions
   - Add visual feedback for player actions
   - Implement smooth transitions between states
   - Consistent visual language for game elements

## Next Milestone: Alpha Release

Target date: TBD

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete enemy variety (at least 10 types)
- Functional formation system with multiple patterns
- Enhanced background with environmental obstacles
- Functional progression system
- Basic level structure
- Balanced combat mechanics
- Initial sound effects and music

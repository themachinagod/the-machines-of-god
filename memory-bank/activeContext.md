# Active Development Context

## Current Development Phase: Phase 2 - Enhanced Gameplay

Our project is now in Phase 2, focusing on enhanced gameplay features including enemy variety, angle-based shooting, and save/load functionality. We're building on the core game loop established in Phase 1 to create a more engaging and dynamic experience.

## Recent Developments

We've successfully implemented several key features:
- Angle-based shooting system that fires projectiles in the direction the player is facing
- Enhanced enemy variety with different movement patterns and behaviors
- Save/load game system with a "Resume Game" option in the main menu
- Basic progression system with score tracking
- Multiple projectile patterns (single, double, triple, quad)
- Basic collectible system for in-game upgrades
- Enemy balance changes:
  - Base enemy health is 20 (appropriate challenge level)
  - Base enemy speed increased from 60 to 120 pixels per second
  - Relative speed adjustments between enemy types:
    - ZigzagEnemy: 10% faster than base speed
    - DartEnemy: 50% faster than base speed
    - HeavyBomber: 80% of base speed with increased health

## Current Work

### Enemy System Enhancement

  - Wormholes for teleportation
  - Radiation zones that slowly damage entities within

### PowerUp System Development
- Create PowerUp class extending base Collectible
- Update CollectibleManager to spawn PowerUps
- Implement different PowerUp types:
  - Weapon: Temporary weapon upgrade
  - Shield: Temporary invulnerability
  - Speed: Movement speed boost
  - Life: Extra player life
- Add visual effects for active powerups
- Develop timer system for powerup duration

### Weapons and Combat
- Fine-tune projectile and missile behavior
- Implement additional projectile patterns
- Add visual and audio feedback for combat
- Improve missile tracking and collision detection

### Progression System
- Implement permanent upgrade system
- Create meaningful progression between sessions
- Design balanced upgrade costs and effects
- Add visual indicators for equipped upgrades

### Polish and Feedback
- Add screen shake and particle effects
- Improve collision detection and death animations
- Add sound effects for various game events
- Implement UI feedback for player actions

## Technical Architecture

The game is built with a state-based architecture using the following key components:

1. **Game State Management**
   - Main menu, playing state, shop, pause, and game over states
   - Smooth transitions between states
   - State-specific input handling and rendering

2. **Entity System**
   - Player with customizable weapons and attributes
   - Various enemy types with different behaviors
   - Projectiles, missiles, and collectibles
   - Health and damage system

3. **Collision System**
   - Group-based collision detection for efficiency
   - Custom handling for special collision cases
   - Health-based damage system

4. **Rendering System**
   - Layer-based rendering for depth control
   - Camera system for screen management
   - UI overlay for game information
   - Parallax background system for visual depth

5. **Input System**
   - Keyboard controls with configurable keys
   - Event-based and polling-based hybrid approach
   - Context-sensitive controls based on game state

6. **Save/Load System**
   - JSON-based save file format
   - Game state persistence between sessions
   - Error handling for data corruption

## Current Implementation Challenges

We're actively working to address these technical challenges:

1. **Enemy Formation System**
   - Need to implement a flexible formation manager
   - Coordinate movement of multiple enemies
   - Balance difficulty of formation-based attacks
   - Synchronize behavior among formation members

2. **Advanced Physics**
   - Implement more complex movement patterns
   - Improve collision response
   - Add environmental effects (gravity wells, etc.)
   - Handle interactions between different force fields

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Maintain 60 FPS target with many entities
   - Implement object pooling for projectiles and particles
   - Optimize collision detection for large numbers of entities
   - Manage memory for dynamic environment elements

4. **UI Polish**
   - Create more responsive menu interactions
   - Add visual feedback for player actions
   - Implement smooth transitions between states
   - Consistent visual language for game elements

5. **PowerUp Implementation Challenges**
   - Balancing temporary powerup effects
   - Clear visual communication of active powerups and remaining duration
   - Integration with existing collectible system
   - Managing multiple simultaneous powerups

## Next Milestone: Alpha Release

Target date: TBD

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete enemy variety (at least 10 types)
- Functional formation system with multiple patterns
- Enhanced background with environmental obstacles
- Functional progression system
- Basic PowerUp system with multiple effect types
- Basic level structure
- Balanced combat mechanics
